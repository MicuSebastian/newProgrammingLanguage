# The work

Write a document of maximum 6 pages containing the language manual and write a parser in Jison for this language. This is intended for a user who has never used the language before. The manual should contain the following:

* how to define variables
* what the data types are
* simple
* complex (strings, objects, etc)
* how data types are represented in memory
* what expressions look like (addition, subtraction and other specific operators)
* syntax of conditional structures (like if)
* syntax of repetitive structures (like while)
* syntax of enumerations (like for)
* syntax of functions (or similar structures)
* syntax of comments
* syntax of comments used for documentation
* other necessary structures
* examples

Add an appendix for each language structure and write the equivalent in webassembly. Elements that cannot be represented in webassembly for be "simulated" using calls to functions that are assumed to exist in a loaded library.
Upload an archive with the manual, jison grammar and JavaScript file to check a program from a file received on the command line.
